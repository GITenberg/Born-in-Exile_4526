description: Leaving his lowly Midlands home to pursue his career as a journalist
  among the free-thinkers of London, Godwin Peak's origins and poverty hinder him
  at every turn. Publishing an article attacking the hypocrisy of the Victorian Church
  gives him his break. His future dims, however, when he falls catastrophically in
  love with the devout Sidwell Warricombe.
